# Human Need

We conducted interviews, through a google form, reaching out to UW students that commonly uses public transport. Each of our group members reached out to our UW friend group and narrowed down interviewees to those who use either public transport or microtransport at least two times a week. 

We then asked interviewees two different questions regarding their experence with traveling around UW:
1. We asked them to describe any negative experiences/complaints that they had while they were using public transport or microtransport
2. We asked them if they would be willing to use microtransport (i.e. rentable scooters or bikes, like the Lime bikes) if they were only traveling a short distance (we arbitrarily chose 2 miles as the upper bound)

Here is a link to the survey that we used: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffCthFfWR_yhLpMFxTJYxWQ4lbTWJFQOA5i1nJoKs6Npo2lA/viewform?usp=sf_link

We got 6 answers each to both questions. Here are the responses to the first question of the survey:

"The buses that stop at the bus stop in front of the pop health building are always late."

"OneBusAway doesn't update with the proper times, so if I'm just trying to travel someplace down the Ave or close to campus (like Ravenna), waiting and taking the bus makes me later than just walking there would."

"I don't use public transport so idk"

"This one time I got to the bus stop right after the final bus for the night left. As a result, I had no way to get home. I ended up taking an uber, which cost like 20 dollars, just to go home. I just lived 1.5 miles away, so it really sucked."

"When I first started commuting to UW, I didn't which side the bus stop was on lol. I missed like two of the buses cause I was standing at the 'north' bus stop instead of the 'south' one"

"The buses being late is really it. Messes with my schedule."

We noted that the majority of the complaints were related to how the buses around campus are generally late or don't stick to the schedule that's posted on OneBusAway (a very popular public transport application), Google Maps, or the one posted on the physical bus stop sign. Two responses also specifically mentioned that the inaccuracy with the bus arrivals actually impeded their journey, making it the same duration as walking there in the case of the second response, and making the full journey more expensive for the fourth responder. 

We also looked at the yes/no respnses to the second question and found that 66% of the respondants said that they would use microtransport for short-distance travel. 

Thus, as far as negative transport experiences go, a significant subset of UW students have an issue with public transport being late when they only need to go a few miles, and would rather use microtransport in these cases. 

Thus, we found that among the student community there was a human need for a centralized domain that gives them choices and information for both bus stops and microtransport services. If a student needs to go somewhere close, the LemUn application allows them to either find a bus stop or find local mircotransport to use on their journey. If a user is already at a bus stop and wants to know if there are any scooters or bikes close-by that may make their journey faster, they can stay on the application and find such vehicles. 

Moreover, the response regarding not knowing which side of the road the bus stop was on also seemed to be an issue for first-time commuters. As an informal interview, Rohan talked to other student commuters during his commute to and from UW, asking them if they had similar experiences. He ended up asking 8 people, 5 of which said yes. As a result, the application also includes a small compass that points directly at the scooter, bike, or bus stop that the user wants to go to. For first time commuters, this circumvents any confusion of which bus stop (since there are generally two with the same name on any street) they need to go to. The compass can also be used to find scooters and bikes, which may be especially helpful if they're not placed on aan actual street.

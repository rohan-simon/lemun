# Audit Changes

Below is a list of changes made following the audit.

- Edited semantics of all app buttons to properly implement semantics.
- Changed overflow behaviour of certain text (i.e. of the legend/filter bar) to exhibit more reasonable behaviour with larger font sizes.
- Changed UI elements (e.g. color and city selectors) to be more intuitive and polished.
- Increased default font size of various elements throughout the app to be more readable and meet contrast requirements.
